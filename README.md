# beta_lactamase_project_molecular_descriptors_using_padelpy -

Beta lactamase is an enzyme produced by bacteria which produced multi-ressistance against antibiotics. In this notebook we will apply 10 moleular fingerprints to investigate  molecular activities. 


 Notebook Outlines: 
 
 1. Preparation of fingerprint present in XML file.
 2. Prepare dataset subset as an input for PadelPy.
 3. Machine Learning model building.
 4. Cross Validation.
